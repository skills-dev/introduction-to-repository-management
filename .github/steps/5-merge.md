# Step 4: Release

With all our preparations ready, it's time to release them!

## ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Merge our collaboration changes

1. In the top navigation, select the **Pull requests** tab.

1. Create a pull request for the `prepare-to-collaborate` branch and merge it.

1. Create a pull request for the `add-issue-templates` branch and merge it.

1. With both pull requests merged, Mona will prepare the final review and acknowledge the exercise as finished! Nice work! You are all done! üéâ

## ü§ì Activity: (optional) Inform the school principal

Congratulations! You've successfully prepared Mergington High's extracurricular activities website for healthy and safe collaboration. Make sure you let the principal know so he can brag to the IT department about your proactive efforts!

Here is a snippet of something you can share:

1. Protected our code from accidental mistakes with `.gitignore` and branch protections.
2. Set clear guidelines for teacher contributions with `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODEOWNERS`.
3. Established community standards with a **Code of Conduct** and structured **issue templates**.
4. Prepared for the future security challenges by enabling automated scanning and providing safe submission procedures.
